Data-oriented projects that I've worked on for fun.

## Project 1: Spotify Streaming History Racing Bar Chart
* Pulled my entire streaming history and imported 20 JSON files holding 350,000 streaming observations.
* Used tidyverse packages and commands to apply dates and fill cumulative sum streaming counts for each artist in order to get data into a time series format.
* Used ggplot and gganimate for final animation.
